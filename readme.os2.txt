This is a quick port of zmakebas for OS/2.

I needed only to add -Zexe to the build flags into the original makefile.

ZMakeBas is actually a program to convert BASIC programs (written for the great Sinclair ZX Spectrum
or its US release, the TS2068) into .TAP files which can be directly loaded into an emulator, or
transferred to a real Speccy.

This port was built with GCC 3.3.5 and the build environment made by Paul Smedley.

For details on how to use zmakebas.exe, read the README file and the included manpage (sorry for
not processing it - I still didn't configure the proper tools).

If you like these programs, please consider making a donation to Paul Smedley, which is doing
a tremendous amount of work to let us have more and more programs updated and new, OS/2 native.

Have fun!
